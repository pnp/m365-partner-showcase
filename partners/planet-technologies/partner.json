          "New technology doesn\u2019t work if your people don\u2019t know how to use it. And, deployment is not adoption. If our IT projects were based solely on the deployment of the technology and could ignore the human factor - implementing new solutions would be the easiest task we ever took on!",
          "The Evolve 365 custom learning program and our Learning Strategists understand the full scope of new technology updates and deployments. We dig into the details of how to prepare and manage them so you don\u2019t have to. This allows you and your team to focus on your work and productivity. In the hybrid workforce world, we have learned it is very different from the past and many things that we have depended on for years, don\u2019t provide the same value now as they previously had. We must adjust our entire approach to keep up to date and meet the needs of this growing workforce. Flexibility is a core piece of this program to meet these different and ever changing needs and future proof your workforce. With all this in mind, Planet Technologies created Evolve 365.",
          "Evolve 365 is a customized learning and adoption program that aligns with the specific needs and culture of your users. Evolve 365 includes a dedicated Learning Strategist familiar with user adoption, the changes of Office 365, and driving users to embrace new technology.
