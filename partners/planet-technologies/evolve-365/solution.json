They often get confused and feel as if they have no resources to help them with the constant changes, they are seeing in Office 365.The trainers within these organizations want to help them, but with limited resources at their disposal, they are struggling to manage the changes as well. They simply have no one to go to for additional help and training. The result is that your users don\u2019t embrace and use the new technologies and revert to the old way of doing things. This means productivity is lost and user frustration grows. \u0026nbsp;\n\u003Cbr\u003E \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMany of the new features that are rolling out will be considered minimal impact to your users as they are considered incremental features. But, what Microsoft considers to be minimal impact to a user\u2019s daily work and what the actual impact can be, may vary greatly. \u0026nbsp;These impacts are often seen with the addition of new features, such as new options on the toolbars or menus. These typically result in a new and easier way to complete the same task a user might have already been working on. In many cases, Microsoft might try to provide education and on-screen guidance for the new features, but often new buttons and new options just show up and users will need to navigate through them to complete common tasks or figure out how to navigate around them. If your users aren\u2019t prepared for these types of constant incremental changes \u2013instead of seeing them as small things to delight them and make their daily tasks easier, they will instead see them as blockers to productivity and will once again become increasingly frustrated with the tools and technology provided to them. At this point they will either start to push against change or they will start to find ways to implement their own shadow IT solutions, completely going around you in the process.\n\u003Cbr\u003E \u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe truth is, managing the new way of doing things is tricky and unless you are doing it all day every day \u2013 it can be overwhelming.
